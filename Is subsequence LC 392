Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true


class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
       // we use two pointers one for S and one for T
        int m = s.size();
        int n = t.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        
        while(left<m and right <n){
            if(s[left]==t[right]){
                left++;
                right++;
            } else {
                right++;
            }
            
        }
        
        return left ==m;
    }
};
